# TaskFlow Product Documentation

## Overview
TaskFlow is a comprehensive project management and team collaboration platform designed to help teams of all sizes organize, track, and complete their work efficiently. With powerful features like task management, time tracking, automations, and integrations, TaskFlow adapts to your team's workflow.

## Getting Started

### Account Setup
When you first sign up for TaskFlow, you'll create your primary workspace. This workspace serves as the home for all your projects and team collaboration. You can customize your workspace name, logo, and settings to match your organization's branding.

### Creating Your First Project
Projects are the containers where all your work happens. To create a project:
1. Click the '+' button in the top right corner
2. Select 'New Project'
3. Enter a project name and optional description
4. Choose project visibility (Private, Team, or Public)
5. Add team members and set their roles
6. Select a project template or start from scratch

### Understanding Workspaces vs Projects
Workspaces are the top-level organizational unit in TaskFlow. Think of them as your company, department, or client. Within a workspace, you create multiple projects for different initiatives, campaigns, or work streams. Each workspace has its own:
- Team members and permissions
- Billing and subscription settings
- Integration configurations
- Custom fields and templates

## Core Features

### Task Management
Tasks are the building blocks of your projects. Each task can include:
- Title and detailed description with rich text formatting
- Assignees (single or multiple team members)
- Due dates and time estimates
- Priority levels (Low, Medium, High, Urgent)
- Status (To Do, In Progress, Review, Done, or custom statuses)
- Tags for categorization
- Attachments up to your plan's file size limit
- Custom fields for additional metadata
- Subtasks and checklists
- Comments and @mentions for collaboration

### Views and Visualization
TaskFlow offers multiple ways to view your work:

**List View**: Traditional task list with sorting and filtering options. Great for detailed work and bulk editing.

**Board View**: Kanban-style board where tasks move through columns. Perfect for visualizing workflow stages and bottlenecks.

**Calendar View**: See all tasks with due dates on a calendar. Drag and drop to reschedule. Sync with Google Calendar or Outlook.

**Gantt Chart**: Timeline view showing task dependencies and project schedule. Available on Professional and Enterprise plans.

**Table View**: Spreadsheet-like interface with all task fields as columns. Excellent for data entry and analysis.

### Time Tracking
Built-in time tracking helps teams understand where time is spent:
- Click-to-start timers on any task
- Manual time entry for past work
- Time tracking continues even if you close your browser
- Billable vs non-billable time categorization
- Detailed time reports by project, team member, or task
- Export time data for invoicing

### Automations
Create powerful automations to eliminate repetitive work:
- Trigger actions based on task changes
- Set conditions with multiple criteria
- Chain multiple actions together
- Examples: "When task is completed, create follow-up task", "When due date approaches, send reminder", "When priority is Urgent, notify manager"
